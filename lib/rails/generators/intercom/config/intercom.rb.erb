  # == Inbox Style
  # This enables the Intercom inbox which allows your users to read their
  # past conversations with your app, as well as start new ones. It is 
  # disabled by default.
  #   * :default shows a small tab with a question mark icon on it
  #   * :custom attaches the inbox open event to an anchor with an
  #             id of #Intercom.
  #
  # config.inbox.style = :default 
  # config.inbox.style = :custom

  # == Inbox Counter
  # If you're using the custom inbox style, you can request that Intercom
  # insert an `em` element into your anchor with the count of unread messages
  #
  # config.inbox.counter = true
